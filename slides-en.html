        # Today&rsquo;s project

        Python can be used for many useful scientific or business applications working with data. But today we'll be doing something fun.

        The [Canadian UFO Survey](http://survey.canadianuforeport.com/) is an organisation which has been collecting data about UFO sightings
        across Canada since 1989.

        They've generously agreed to let us use their data for this workshop (thanks!)

        ## What is programming? What is code?

        * A program starts out as a text file filled with *commands* we want the computer to execute
        * Writing these special files is what we mean when we say "writing code"
        * Programming languages like python give us tools to write those commands more easily
        * In python these have the file extension `.py`
        * Another special program takes the file and translates the python commands into another form the computer can use

        ## Running Python in PyCharm

        The console is an interactive tool used to test and debug code and is included in PyCharm! Let&rsquo;s open the console:

        ![Tools &gt; Python Console&hellip;](./framework/img/workshop/open-console1.png)

        The console will pop up at the bottom of the application. Type code (instructions) after the green `>>>` symbol. This symbol is used to represent a space to enter your input but you don&rsquo;t have to actually type it.

        ![Python Console in PyCharm](./framework/img/workshop/open-console2.png)

        **Pro tip!** You can also open and close the console by selecting the icon in the lower left of PyCharm.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Python can do math

        In the console, after the `>>>`, try out these examples.

        The command you input after the `>>>` gets *evaluated* and a value is returned back to you.

        ```
        >>> 2 + 2
        4
        ```

        ```
        >>> 2 * 15

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Data Types

        The previous example used the *integer* number **type** but there are many more.

        * Integer (`int`, whole numbers)
        * Float (`float`, numbers containing decimals)
        * String (`str`, words, sentences, literal text)
        * Boolean (`True`, `False`)
        * [and many more!](http://www.diveintopython3.net/native-datatypes.html)

        To display the type, use `type()` and a data value inside the parentheses.

        ```
        >>> type("hello")
        <class 'str'>

        >>> type(42)
        <class 'int'>

        >>> type(3.14159)

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Printing

        The `print()` **function** (more on this later) outputs values to the screen.

        Note the syntax in the examples. Quotes should be included when using a *string* data type.

        ```
        >>> print("Hello World!")
        Hello World!
        ```

        ```
        >>> print(2 + 2)
        4
        ```

        ```
        >>> print("2 + 2")

        ## Concatenation
        **Concatenation** is used to "add" strings together by joining multiple strings into one.

        ```python
        >>> print("Hello " + "World!")
        Hello World!
        ```

        More than two:

        ```python
        >>> print("Hello " + "Ladies " + "Learning " + "Code!")
        Hello Ladies Learning Code!

        ## Variables

        * Used to store a value to use whenever you need it
        * Variables store data in the computer&rsquo;s memory and a **variable name** is used to fetch their value

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Variables (Continued)

         Use the equal (`=`) symbol to **assign** a value to a variable.

        ```python
        >>> x = 5
        >>> print(x)
        5
        ```
        Python can do math with variables:
        ```python
        >>> x = 5
        >>> y = 4
        >>> x * y
        20
        ```
        You can store almost anything in a variable, including a string:
        ```python
        >>> animal = "python"
        >>> print("My favourite animal is a " + animal)
        My favourite animal is a python
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Reassigning Variables

        Variables can be changed after the initial declaration by "reassigning" them.

        #### strings

        ```python
        >>> animal = "hedgehog"
        >>> print("My favourite animal is a " + animal)
        My favourite animal is a hedgehog
        ```

        #### math

        ```python
        >>> y = 10
        >>> x * y
        ```

        What do you think the value of `x * y` will be? <span class="delayed">`50`</span>

        Why?<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        You changed <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->`y`, but the old value of `x` is still in memory.
        Python will remember variable names until you close PyCharm or [clear them manually](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#the-del-statement).

    <section class="slide list-font-default" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## What's in a name?

        Here are some tips & best practices for creating variable names:

        * variable names can only use letters, numbers and the underscore (`_`)
          * no spaces!
        * separate words with the underscore `_` symbol
          * `ladies_learning_code`
        * they cannot begin with a number
          * `1day` gives you an error, `day1` will work.
        * variable names should describe the data being stored in them
          *  `animal = "python"` is better than `a = "python"`
          * `animal = "python"` is better than `thing = "python"`

<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ## Conditionals &amp; Logic

    When you get ready in the morning you might check the weather to decide what to wear.

    ![Getting Dressed!](framework/img/workshop/weather.gif) <!-- .element: style="width: 25%" -->


    * Is it cold outside? Wear long johns
    * Is it raining? Bring an umbrella

    When you do this you are evaluating a **condition** (the weather) for true/false value and then making a decision.
    Python can do this too.


  </script>
</section>

<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ## Boolean values

    Programming languages have **boolean** values called `True` and `False`

    They are the result of testing a condition.
    ### Example
    Is it snowing outside? That is either `True` or `False`.

    Try this in the console. Create a variable called `weather`
    ```python
    >>> weather = "snowing"
    ```

    Now test it against other weather values.

    The double equals symbol (`==`) will check if the value on the right matches the value stored in the variable.

    ```
    >>> weather == "cold"
    False
    >>> weather == "snowing"
    True
    >>> weather == "Snowing"
    False
    ```
  </script>
</section>

<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ## Comparison operators

    We used ` == ` to compare strings. How do we compare numbers?

    ### Comparison Operators
        `x == y` : are x and y equal
        `x > y` : is x greater than y

        `x < y` : is x less than y

        `x >= y` : is x  greater than or equal to y

        `x <= y` : is x less than or equal to y

    Try this in the console

    ```python
    >>> x = 4
    >>> y = 10
    >>> x < y
    True
    >>> x > y
    False
    ```
  </script>
</section>

<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ## Conditionals &amp; Logic (Continued)

    `if` statements are used to execute different sets of instructions based on the result of a conditional test.

    Each `if` statement contains a test. The indented block is the code that will run if the test is `True`

    ```python
    weather = "snowing"
    if weather == "snowing":
       print("Wear snowpants")
    ```
    You can check more than one per `if` block by adding an `elif`.

    The `else` block will run if none of the others are true.
    ```python
    weather = "snowing"
    if weather == "snowing":
      print("Wear snowpants")
    elif weather == "raining":
      print("Bring an umbrella")
    else:
      print("Who knows?")

    ```

  </script>

<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ## Indentation

    In python, indentation is important.

    This will not work:
    ```python
      weather = "snowing"
      if weather == "snowing":
      print("Wear snowpants")

       ```


       Python will give you an error:
       ```python

    In your file `weather_advice.py`:

    * Copy this snippet into the file and change the value for the weather.

        Sometimes, you can&rsquo;t neatly capture your conditions with one expression. You may need to combine multiple tests to determine what to do next.

        `and`: both things must be true

        `or`: either one, or both things must be true

        ### Example
        Suppose a peice of advice applies to multiple situations. This indented block will run in either case.

        Variables allowed us to store one simple peice of data so far.

        What about more complex data?

        `Data structures` is the fancy term we use to refer to storing that data based on what the data looks like.


        * Have a bunch of individual things?  &rightarrow;  `list` or `array`.
         * Example: to-do list
        * Have pairs of values that relate to eachother? &rightarrow; `dictionary`.
         * Example: A class of students' names and scores on a test
        * Have hierarchical data? &rightarrow; `tree`.
         * Example: family tree
        * Have stuff that needs to be processed in order? &rightarrow; `queue`.

        ## Lists

        When we have collections of similar individual things, we might store them in a **list**.

        To create a list, type a name for the list, then `=`, then put the items in square brackets.

        ```python
        the_name_of_the_list = ['items', 'separated', 'by', 'commas']
        ```

        #### Examples:

        ```python
         weather_conditions = ['rainy', 'snowing', 'cloudy', 'sunny', 'foggy']

         provinces = ['BC', 'AB', 'SK', 'MB', 'ON', 'QC', 'NL', 'NB', 'NS', 'PE', 'YT', 'NT', 'NU']

         to_do_list = ['Water plants', 'Clean bathroom', 'Buy shoes', 'Become Prime Minister', 'Solve climate change']

         prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
        ```

        Just like with variables we want to give our lists good, descriptive names.

        weather_conditions = ['rainy', 'snowing', 'cloudy', 'sunny', 'foggy']

    ## Opening a file

    In this section we will be working with a small subset of our UFO sightings data.

    Open the file `ufo-subset.csv` in a text editor.
    This is one example of how you can store data, in a **.csv** (comma-separated values) file. It looks like a spreadsheet.

    If you want to work with data you need to be able to get python to read the data from a file.

    If you (a human) want to open and read a file, you:

    1. Find the file on your file system
    1. Open the file
    1. Read the data in it
    1. Close the file when you're done with it


  </script>
</section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Read the whole file

        Python does something similar. To get data from a file:

        1. Tell python where to find the file
        1. Tell python to open the file
        1. Tell python how much data to read (all of it? one line at a time?)
        1. Tell python to close the file when it's done

        Open the file called `working_with_files.py` and run it.

        ```python
        ufo_data_file = open('ufo-subset.csv', 'r') # this tells python to open the file

        ufo_data_file.read()   # read all the data in the file

        ufo_data_file.close()  # close it

        ```

        Nothing Happened! Why?
        Tell python to output the data out to the screen by wrapping the second command in a `print()`

        ```python
        print(ufo_data_file.read())
        ```

        ## Recap

        What did we just do?

         Call `open()` on a file named **ufo-subset.csv** in **read** mode and give it back to me:

        ```python
        open('ufo-subset.csv', 'r')
        ```

         Store that file in a variable so I can call functions on it:

        ```python
        ufo_data_file = open('ufo-subset.csv', 'r')
        ```

        Call the `read()` function to read all the data in the file at once and print it to the console:

        ```python
        print(ufo_data_file.read())
        ```

         I'm done! Call the `close()` function to close the file:

        ```python
        ufo_data_file.close()
        ```

        ## Read individual lines (or cells)

        In order to do interesting things with this data, we need to be able to access each row or even specific values.

        For example, to count all of the sightings near Gimli, Manitoba in 2017, we'd need to be able to

        1. look at each row
        1. check if it's in 2017 (the "Year" column)
        1. check if it's in Manitoba (the "Province" column)
        1. check if it's in Gimli (the "Location" column)
        1. do something with that information

        We need a **data structure** to effectively work with this data.

        ## Libraries

        Python has many useful built in **libraries** &mdash; collections of code that other people have written.

        Today we&rsquo;ll use the **csv** library to help us read the data in the file and transform it to give it structure.

        That will give more functions to help us work with csv files.

        ## Using a library

        To use a library, add an **import** statement at the top of your .py file. Now you can call any of the functions in that library.

        ```python
         import csv
        ```

        Once you have opened a csv file, the csv library can:

        1. Give you a special object called a *reader* that knows how to read one line at a time
        1. Convert each line of the file into a dictionary
        1. Then we can do something with the data

<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ## Reading data from a CSV file

    Today we&rsquo;ll use the `DictReader` tool to access the values.

    ```python
    import csv   # import the `csv` library
    ufo_data_file = open('ufo-subset.csv', 'r') # open the file
    ufo_data_dictionary_reader = csv.DictReader(ufo_data_file) # pass the file into `DictReader`
   ```

    Calling `DictReader()` gives us the ability to ask for the next line in the file using `next()`
     Store it in a variable and print it out

    ```python
    sighting = next(ufo_data_dictionary_reader)   # get the next row
    print(sighting)
   ```

    What is this?
    ```python
    OrderedDict([('Year', '2016'), ('Month', '9'), ('Day', '16'), ('Location', 'Iqaluit'), ('Province', 'NU')])
       ```
  </script>
</section>

<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ## Dictionaries

    Python used `DictReader` to read a row in the file and transform it into a **dictionary**, a bunch of *key: value pairs*.

    This is just like a regular dictionary:
     > **[python](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/python)** : any of several Old World boa constrictors of the subfamily Pythoninae, often growing to a length of more than 20 feet

     The console printed out the sighting like this:
      ```python
      OrderedDict([('Year', '2016'), ('Month', '9'), ('Day', '16'), ('Location', 'Iqaluit'), ('Province', 'NU')])
       ```

    But think of it like this:
    > **Year**: '2016'

    > **Month**: '9'

    >  **Day**: '16'

    > **Location** : 'Iqaluit'

    > **Province** : 'NU'


    Python can 'look up' each value in a row just as you would the meaning of the word *python*.

    ```python
     print(sighting['Year'])
     print(sighting['Location'])
    ```
  </script>
</section>
<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">

    ufo_data_dictionary_reader = csv.DictReader(ufo_data_file)

    sighting = next(ufo_data_dictionary_reader)
    print(sighting)
    sighting = next(ufo_data_dictionary_reader)
    print(sighting)

      if sighting['Province'] == 'MB':
       sightings_in_mb.append(sighting)

    ufo_data_file.close()
